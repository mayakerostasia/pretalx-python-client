# Pretalx Python Client
##### By Maya Kerostasia

A simple python Pretalx API wrapper, primarily made for [Pyladies-Conference-Portal](https://github.com/pyladies/pyladiescon-portal)

Unsure atm whether this will be uploaded to PyPi or incorporated directly into the conference architecture


# TODO:
1: Change structure to library  
2: Determine whether or not this will be uploaded to PyPi
